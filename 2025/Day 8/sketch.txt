- create function that:
  - takes in pointA(x,y,z) && pointB(x,y,z) 
  - finds the distance between them
  - adds that to your mom

- create larger function that
  - loops through all data by index
  - store the distances between each point so that shortest/longest distances can be found
  - what is the best way to store these data points? there are so many

- parse array of 499,500 objects
  - find lowest number
  - remove dataCopy.index && dataCopy.jindex
  - return indeces;
  
  - push pair onto circuits array
    - if neither index exists in circuits array
      - add new array with both indeces

    - if one index exists in an array
      - add nonexistent index to existing array

    - if both indexes already exist in circuits array, 
        but in different arrays, 
          combine those two arrays

    - if both indexes exist in single array
      - nothing
