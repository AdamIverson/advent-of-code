find the biggest rectangle, asshat

496 rows of x,y coordinates

compare each individual coordinate to the other 495 coordinates
for ( let i - 0; i < rawData.length -1; i++){
  console.log(rawData[i])
}

let xDiff = 1
let yDiff = 1

xDiff = if (Math.abs(rawData[i][0] - rawData[i + j][0]) > 1) {
  xDiff = Math.abs(rawData[i][0] - rawData[i + j][0])
  return { xDiff, i, j}
}

yDiff =  if (Math.abs(rawData[i][1] - rawData[i + j][1]) > 1) {
  yDiff = (Math.abs(rawData[i][1] - rawData[i + j][1]))
  return = {yDiff, i, j}
}

const area = (xDiff x yDiff)


coordinateNums is an array of 496 pairs or x/y coordinates
comparing every coordinateNums pair against every other is too much
  so we are going to process a pair against every higher index,
   sort all results so that the highest number is [-1]
    push [-1] onto the largestArea array, the .length of which should be 496

diffFinder is a function that finds the distance between the submitted point and
  every point of a higher index

we need to loop through coordinateNums
  run diffFinder against every index
